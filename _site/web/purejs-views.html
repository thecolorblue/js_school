<h2 id="Views">Views</h2>
<p>Views are the interface to the document object model (<span class="caps">DOM</span>). This is how the browser renders each page, it takes html and turns it into a document. It also provides a low level interface to javascript to change the <span class="caps">DOM</span>.</p>
<p>You can find more details about the <span class="caps">DOM</span> interface <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/DOM_Reference">here</a>.</p>
<p>The interface is cumbersome, and historically was not consistent between browsers. There are now very well laid out standards for the <span class="caps">DOM</span> but you still want to make it easier on yourself to make edits. Some features you will be using a lot. Others you might not use at all. So each application you right should have a set of functions and objects that make interacting with the <span class="caps">DOM</span> easier.</p>
<p>jQuery is a great example of make the <span class="caps">DOM</span> easier to work with.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript">	<span class="c1">// native DOM interface</span>
	<span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;content&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">getElementByClassName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;wrap&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">classList</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;inner&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>

</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, using jQuery is much easier to read and is less to type. Even though the <span class="caps">DOM</span> interface is more explicit, in jQuery, the statement is just as clear.</p>
<p>The D3.js library is very similar to jQuery, except is focused on Scalable Vector Graphics (<span class="caps">SVG</span>). <span class="caps">SVG</span> is another node, similar to a div, but has a different way to handle layouts and different child nodes. It&#8217;s designed to render graphics.</p>
<h2 id="DOM">Create A New <span class="caps">DOM</span> Interface</h2>
<p>Its good to know ahead of time what you want this app to do. How many buttons are you going to have? How are you going to arrange them.</p>
<p>If you know you will have a menu, you will get better performance by attaching only one event listener. Also, if you want to add to the menu, you will not have to reattach any new event listeners.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript">	<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">menu</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;menu&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>

	<span class="nx">menu</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;click&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
		<span class="c1">// find your element</span>
		<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">menuItem</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">target</span><span class="p">;</span>

		<span class="c1">// tell your controller what happened</span>
		<span class="c1">// this is an example</span>
		<span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">triggerEvent</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;click&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;menu&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">target</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">);</span>


	<span class="p">},</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">);</span>

<p>This is a simple example, but its supposed to be. The controller, here is is called &#8220;app&#8221;, should worry about what happens after the event, the view should properly tell the controller what happened. Here, the controller object has a crazy trigger interface that takes the event name, the context, the element target, and the event object. Usually, the controller does not need to know this much info. You should really only send enough data for the controller to figure out what it needs to do.</p>

<h3 id="formdata">FormData</h3>
<p>the &#8220;FormData&#8221; object is relatively new, part of the changes included in HTML5, but it fixes one of fundemental bugs with the XMLHTTPRequest (these changes are often called XMLHTTPRequest2). With the FormData object you can now upload files in a clean way in javascript and <span class="caps">AJAX</span> without having to use iframes or flash. Tied in with File and Blob objects, you have a pretty powerful tool.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">form</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">FormData</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="nx">form</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;title&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;French Toast&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">form</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;description&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;authentic french toast.&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>


<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">request</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">XMLHttpRequest</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nx">request</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;POST&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;http://yourwebsite.com/post&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">request</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">form</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The feature that I like the most is that you basically create your own form in javascript, making it easier to control exactly what each field has for data. I should note here that FormData acts like a black box. Once you append a value to a key you cannot get it back.</p>
